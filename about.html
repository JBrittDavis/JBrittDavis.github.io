    <p>I am an anthropological archaeologist who is interested in using Early Maya ceramic networks to examine changes in economic structures that coincide with increasing socio-political complexity. Generally, I am interested in macroscopic, microscopic, chemical, and iconographic ceramic analyses in Mesoamerica and the US Southwest. I have several years of Cultural Resource Management experience in the US Southwest and Southeast, both field teching and field directing.</p>
